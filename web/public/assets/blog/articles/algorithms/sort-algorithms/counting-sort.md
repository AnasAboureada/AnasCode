# Counting Sort

- Assume that all elements of A[1 … n] are integers from 1 to M.
- By a single scan of the array A, count the number of occurrences of each 1 ≤ k ≤ M in the array A and store it in Count[k].
- Using this information, fill in the sorted array A′.
- Provided that all elements of A[1 … n] are integers from 1 to M, CountSort(A) sorts A in time **O(n + M)**.
