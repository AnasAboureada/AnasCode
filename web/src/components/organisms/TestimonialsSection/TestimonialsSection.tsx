    I had the pleasure of working together with Anas during my time as Product at Zoover.
    He lead one of the two development teams in one of the most interesting times for the company.
    We were tasked to build out the product to support the business transformation and turn Zoover into a online travel booking platform.
    Every day he worked side by side with the team leading, coaching and helping them be the best they could be.
    I always enjoyed how he ran the daily standups, his sense of calm and personal approach made starting the day always a very enjoyable experience.
    Heâ€™s an experienced Full-stack developer with a top-notch experience and understand that building product can only be done by amazing people.
    I really enjoyed working together and hope I get the chance to do so again in the future.`,

     He's self driven, motivated by challenge, has a strong work ethic and is constantly looking to improve.
     From day one Anas did two things that impressed me. Firstly,
      he dove straight into the teams work, trying to add value as quickly as possible and he did.
     Secondly, his first request from me was about feedback and how to setup a development plan to help him reach his next goals.
     Anas is a very caring teammate and I'm happy to see him take the next steps in becoming a leader.
     Anas is a great person to have on your team, in your company and as your friend.`,
